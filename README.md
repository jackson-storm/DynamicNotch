## 📁 About

Modern MacBook displays include a notch, but it’s often unused space. **DynamicNotch** turns that space into an interactive UI surface, giving quick visual feedback for things like system events or app notifications — much like Dynamic Island on iPhone.

## 🧪 Requirements

- macOS with a **notch** (e.g., MacBook Pro 14"/16" models)  
- Xcode (for building from source)  
- Swift / SwiftUI support

## 🛠 Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackson-storm/DynamicNotch.git
cd DynamicNotch
open DynamicNotch.xcodeproj
